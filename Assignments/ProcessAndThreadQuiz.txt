Q) advantage and a disadvantage of implementing threads in user space ?
Soln:
The advantage is that context switching between threads is faster because it does not require a trap into the kernel. 
The disadvantage is that, if a user thread blocks in the kernel (e.g., waiting for I/O), no other threads in the process can run.
