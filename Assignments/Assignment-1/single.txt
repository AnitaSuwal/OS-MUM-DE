1. In Fig. 2-2 (pg 90), three process states are shown. In theory, with three states, there could be six transition, two out of each state. 
However, only four transitions are shown. Are there any circumstances in which either or both of the missing transitions might occur?

Soln : 
Yes, two other circumstances are :
   - Transition from blocked to running. Suppose a process is blocked waiting for an input and CPU remains idle. And whenever an input comes, the process can go directly to running state.
   - Transition from ready to blocked state. This transition seems to be not possible as the process in the ready state which isn't running can't do any I/O task that might block it.


3. On all current computers, at least part of the interrupt handlers are written in assembly language. Why? 

Soln :
There are some task that occurs while handling an interrupt like saving a register. And these kind of task where access to hardware is required isn't allowed in high-level languages. Since these kind of task are crucial and requires high performance, assembly language are used.
